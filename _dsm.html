<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Background</h3>

  <p>Container terminal operations are inherently unpredictable; container ships do not arrive on a fixed schedule and schedules change with little notice. This unpredictability can make it difficult to properly and efficiently schedule human resources.</p>
	<p>Additionally, due to differences in crane speeds, uneven distribution of work across quay and yard locations, and varying levels of congestion at different times of the day and week, productivity-based incentives are inequitable unless staff are evenly rotated across equipment and time-slots.</p>
  <p>Thus, a <span class="font-weight-medium">dynamic scheduling system</span> is needed to reduce idle staff and maximize productivity. This system must be able to revise the schedule at any time, adapting the staffing level to the changing demand.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Purpose</h3>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">The Dynamic Schedule Module (DSM) automates and optimizes the creation of staff schedules</span> to minimize the cost of human resources. Schedules are based on forecasted demand and can be manipulated dynamically when demand changes.</p>
  <p class="bg-light border-purple-light p-3 rounded-custom"><span class="font-weight-medium">DSM</span> determines hiring needs, assigns <span class="font-weight-medium">on-call</span> employees to avoid overstaffing, and ensures equity in productivity-based incentives through equipment and shift rotation.</p>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">DSM</span> also conforms to labor laws and company regulations.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Functionality</h3>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">DSM</span> offers two unique utilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <span class="font-weight-bold">simulator</span>, which helps recruitment planners determine hiring needs by generating the number of required new employees using a rolling-basis demand over a selected time interval (e.g. weeks, months, years).</li>
    <li>A <span class="font-weight-bold">schedule generator</span>, which builds cost-efficient schedules based on forecasted demand. It remains flexible by allowing schedules to be updated as demand changes.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Simulator</h3>
  <p>The simulator is a planning tool that <span class="font-weight-medium">determines the total number of employees that should be on staff.</span> It uses expected demand to minimize the total required staff.</p>
  <p>The simulator was tested in two container terminals (<a href="https://www.kingabdullahport.com.sa/" target="_blank">KAP</a> and <a href="http://www.bctc-lb.com/" target="_blank">BCTC</a>) and demonstrated a significant decrease in the required workforce for both.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Schedule Generator</h3>
  <p>The schedule generator creates cost-optimized schedules using demand, configuration of the labor force, labor laws and company regulations, and other cost factors. The list of inputs is customizable to conform to specific terminal needs.</p>
  <img src="images/calendar.jpeg" class="d-none d-md-block float-left img-fluid img-thumbnail mr-3 mb-3" width="225" />
  <img src="images/calendar.jpeg" class="d-none d-sm-block d-md-none float-left img-fluid img-thumbnail mb-3 mr-3" width="160"/>
  <img src="images/calendar.jpeg" class="d-sm-none img-fluid float-left img-thumbnail mb-3 mr-3" width="120" />
  <p>The system calculates the <span class="font-weight-medium">absolute fixed cost</span> that any employee must be paid when they are assigned to work. This incorporates any number of relevant costs, such as:</p>
  <ul class="ofl-fix">
    <li>Salary</li>
    <li>Overhead</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>Food allowance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <span class="font-weight-medium">absolute fixed cost</span> is used to determine when it is beneficial to bring someone new in to work rather than having an on-site employee work <span class="font-weight-medium">overtime</span> hours.</p>
  <p>An <span class="font-weight-medium">on-call system</span> is also employed to allow for unexpected demand increases to be met without paying the full rate of an on-site employee. On-call employees do not attend work, but may be called in at any time, at which point their rate will be increased to that of an on-site employee.</p>
	<p class="bg-light border-purple-light p-3 rounded-custom">The concept of <span class="font-weight-medium">on-call staff</span> is integral; implementing on-call staff prevents overstaffing and ensures all on-site workers are being utilized.</p>
  <p>Thus, for a given time-block, staff can have one of the follow status:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Not scheduled</li>
		<li>On-call</li>
    <li>Scheduled to work on-site</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">Overtime and on-call</span> can be assigned on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">On-Call</h3>
  <p>There is an average number of employees needed each day, but this number fluctuates from day to day. This is the basis for the <span class="font-weight-medium">on-call system</span>.</p>
  <div class="border-purple-light p-3 bg-light rounded-custom mb-3">
    <p class="font-weight-medium">An example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A weekly plan estimates that ten employees will be needed on Tuesday and seven employees will be needed on Wednesday.</li>
      <li>On Monday, the port is notified that a ship originally scheduled to arrive on Tuesday will not arrive until Wednesday.</li>
      <li>Without an on-call system, three employees who are paid to be on-site on Tuesday, but will be idle. The next day, the seven scheduled employees will be unable to keep up with demand.</li>
      <li>With an on-call system, on both days seven employees will be scheduled to be on-site and three employees will be scheduled for on-call. On Tuesday, the on-call employees will not be asked to attend work and there will be no idle employees. On Wednesday, the on-call employees will be asked to attend work and thus will be able to keep up with demand.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Thus, <span class="font-weight-medium">DSM</span> minimizes cost by maximizing on-site staff utilization.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Scheduling Constraints</h3>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">DSM</span> considers the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Skill Level:</span> The system allows the entry of a “skill level” (0-10 scale) based on productivity and ability. This is used to ensure that each shift has staff with a mix of skill levels, which facilitates consistent performance across all shifts.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Adjustments:</span> The system allows immediate adjustments such as adding/dropping.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Shift Time:</span> The system allows for the selection of varying start/end shift times for different employees and provides flexible shift lengths for all employees.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Equipment:</span> The system allows multi-skilled staff members to rotate across equipment types.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Relief Staff:</span> The system allows for allocation of relief staff. </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Equity:</span> The system ensures that all staff have equal productivity potential by evenly distributing:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Working hours</li>
      <li>Overtime hours</li>
      <li>Shift duration</li>
      <li>Days off</li>
      <li>Night and day shifts</li>
      <li>Equipment assignment</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Equity</h3>
  <img src="images/wooden-boys.jpeg" class="d-none d-lg-block float-right img-fluid img-thumbnail ml-3 mb-3" width="300"/>
  <img src="images/wooden-boys.jpeg" class="d-none d-sm-block d-lg-none float-right img-fluid img-thumbnail mb-3 ml-3" width="200"/>
  <img src="images/wooden-boys.jpeg" class="d-sm-none img-fluid float-right img-thumbnail mb-3 mt-2 ml-3" width="140" />
  <p>Since some shifts are more productive than others, <span class="font-weight-medium">DSM</span> rotates employees evenly between day and night shifts and balances days off between weekends and weekdays.</p>
  <p>Additionally, cranes can have different operating speeds and frequency of use, so <span class="font-weight-medium">DSM</span> rotates employees across equipment.</p>
  <p class="bg-light border-purple-light p-3 rounded-custom ofl-fix">DSM’s <span class="font-weight-medium">unique rotation system</span> provides equal opportunity for productivity to all employees. This allows terminals to fairly offer productivity-based incentives, promoting a <span class="font-weight-medium">positive and enthusiastic workforce.</span></p>
  <p>The base system handles seniority and highly-skilled workers with higher pay; they are still rotated evenly with all other employees. However, the option exists to allow them to also have priority for certain preferred equipment or time-slots. This will, however, compromise the system’s equity measures and thus the ability to fairly offer productivity-based incentives.</p>
