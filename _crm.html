<h5 class="text-muted">Container Relocation Module</h5>
<p>Minimizing Unproductive Container Moves</p>
<hr />

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Background</h3>
  <p>Due to limited space within the storage yard, containers are stacked in columns that are only accessible from the top. Thus, in order to retrieve a container that is not on the top of a stack, the blocking containers above this container must be relocated to a different column.</p>
  <p>The column selected for relocation of the blocking container can have a significant impact on the operational efficiency of the storage yard, as <span class="font-weight-medium">optimal placement can minimize the number of future relocations needed</span>, which reduces wait time for customers, operating costs for port managers, and environmental impact.</p>
  <p>Currently, the selection of a column for relocation of a blocking container is not optimized. Typically the blocking container is moved to a nearby column with the fewest containers.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Purpose</h3>
  <p class="bg-light border-purple-light p-2 rounded-custom"><span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> automatically determines the optimal relocation move for blocking containers during the retrieval of a requested container, as well as the optimal placement within a block when stacking a new container.</p>
  <p>It uses container retrieval order to <span class="font-weight-medium">maximize operational efficiency</span> by minimizing the number of future relocations that are caused by the placement of blocking or new containers</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Functionality</h3>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> has two functions:</p>
  <ul></ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Case 1.</span> Determining placement within a block for the relocation of a blocking container during the retrieval of a requested container</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Case 2.</span> Determining placement within a block when stacking a new container</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="bg-light border-purple-light p-2 rounded-custom">At a high level, <span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> accepts in a container ID to retrieve <span class="font-weight-medium">(case 1)</span> or a specified block to stack a new container <span class="font-weight-medium">(case 2)</span> and outputs the optimized set of moves that should be taken to complete this action.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Software Module</h3>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> is a smart-stacking decision module that communicates with a <span class="font-weight-medium">Terminal Operating System (TOS).</span></p>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> receives data from the <span class="font-weight-medium">TOS</span> about containers currently stacked in the yard to determine container departure order and sends the list of optimal moves to be performed to the <span class="font-weight-medium">TOS</span> as instructions for use by crane operators.</p>
  <p>The module will continuously refresh its information and update the expected container retrieval order based on changes in the yard.</p>
  <p>If the terminal has implemented a <span class="font-weight-medium">Prediction System (PS)</span> for container retrieval times or a <span class="font-weight-medium">Truck Appointment System (TAS),</span> <span class="font-weight-medium">CRPM</span> will also receive data from these systems.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Components</h3>
  <p>The module consists of four components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Departure Order Generator:</span> Using the <span class="font-weight-medium">TOS</span> data (and <span class="font-weight-medium">PS</span> and <span class="font-weight-medium">TAS</span> data, if available), generates an order of departure for all containers in the terminal. The data is updated in real-time, adapting to short-notice requests.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Virtual Port:</span> Stores data for all containers in the port, such as location (block, row, column, position) and retrieval order. Receives data from the <span class="font-weight-medium">TOS</span> and <span class="font-weight-medium">Departure Order Generator.</span> The Virtual Port is updated in real-time.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Stacking Move Generator:</span> Using the departure order from the <span class="font-weight-medium">Virtual Port</span> and a placement block chosen by the planner, outputs the best column to stack a container.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Retrieval Relocation Move Generator:</span> Using the departure order data from the <span class="font-weight-medium">Virtual Port</span> and the container ID to retrieve, generates a list of moves resulting in the retrieval of the desired container and outputs this to the <span class="font-weight-medium">TOS</span>.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Inputs</h3>
  <p><span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> communicates in real-time with the <span class="font-weight-medium">TOS</span> (and <span class="font-weight-medium">PS</span> and <span class="font-weight-medium">TAS</span>, if available) to maintain a store of current information about the terminal yard. This picture of the yard, stored in the <span class="font-weight-medium">Virtual Port</span>, is supplemented with departure order information from the <span class="font-weight-medium">Departure Order Generator</span>, and then forms the base informational input utilized by the optimization algorithm.</p>
  <p>For both <span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> functional cases, retrieval and stack, specific user input is required in addition to the automatically processed yard information.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the <span class="font-weight-medium">retrieval case,</span> the planner will enter the container ID of the desired container to be retrieved.</li>
    <li>For the <span class="font-weight-medium">new container stacking case,</span> the operator must enter the block in which the new container will be stacked.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="bg-light border-purple-light p-2 rounded-custom">
    <p>To summarize, <span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> requires the following inputs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Container locations</span></li>
      <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Container departure order</span></li>
      <li><span class="font-weight-medium">Container ID (case 1) or Block ID (case 2)</span></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Outputs</h3>
  <p>In both functional cases, <span class="font-weight-medium">CRM</span> returns a list of operating instructions that will be sent to the <span class="font-weight-medium">TOS.</span></p>
  <p>For the stacking of a new container, the returned list will contain a single instruction.</p>
  <p>For container retrieval, the list will contain the instructions for any required relocations followed by the retrieval of the requested container.</p>
